## Time Tracking for Visualizers

### Real-Time Work Session Tracking
The system provides sophisticated time tracking specifically designed for 3D visualization work:

**Timer Features:**
- **One Active Timer Rule**: Each visualizer can only have one active timer
- **Real-Time Display**: Live timer updates in browser

### 3D Artist Productivity Metrics
```python
# Actual fields from your models for performance calculations:
# TimeSession.duration_minutes - individual work session time
# TaskAssignment.status - assignment completion status
# DailyTimeTotal.total_minutes - daily aggregated time per assignment
# TaskAssignment.completion_date - when assignment was finished

# [PLANNED] Future performance calculations for 3D visualizers:
def calculate_artist_metrics(team_member, period):
    # Query actual model fields
    time_sessions = TimeSession.objects.filter(team_member=team_member, date_worked__in=period)
    completed_assignments = TaskAssignment.objects.filter(
        assigned_to=team_member, 
        status='COMPLETED',
        completion_date__in=period
    )
    
    total_minutes = sum(session.duration_minutes for session in time_sessions)
    assignments_completed = completed_assignments.count()
    
    return {
        'total_minutes_logged': total_minutes,
        'assignments_completed': assignments_completed,
